# Starbucks_Capstone_Project


This repository houses the code and report for my Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Capstone project.

# Project Overview
This dataset consists of simulated data reflecting customer behavior on the Starbucks Rewards mobile app. Periodically, Starbucks sends offers to app users. These offers vary from simple advertisements for a drink to promotional deals like discounts or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users may not receive any offers during certain weeks, and not all users get the same offer. The challenge is to analyze and determine which demographic groups respond best to different types of offers by combining transaction, demographic, and offer data. Note that this dataset is a simplified version of the actual Starbucks app data, as the simulator only includes one product, whereas Starbucks offers a wide variety of products.

# Problem Statement
The main goal is to analyze the dataset and build a predictive model that can determine whether an individual will respond to a given offer.
